- Implemented "Audio" palette in RME which is form containing controls for audio configuration.
- Long time spent figuring out how brushes and their rendering work in RME. 
- Implemented "point" and "area" audio types brushes rendering.
- Implemented "point" and "area" audio types rendering when they're already drawn by corresponding brush on the map, i.e. when they're associated with particular tile.
	Point audio source also has red circle drawn, indicating its radius.
- Improved settings management for audio setup and rendering on the map.
- Put new icons from Kris for audio sources and areas.
- Setup some code for audio XML loading and saving. Now need to implement loading / saving methods.
- Implmented audio XML file saving and loading.
- Fixed name text input blocking by palette hotkeys mechanism.
- Made RME load fof.dat / fof.spr files instead of Tibia.dat / Tibia.spr.
- Refactored audio setup UI: changed "Is looping" to "Is repetitive" and added "play time" / "play random time" and "pause time" / "pause random time" fields.
- Spent long time debugging and figuring out how to properly select various objects in RME.
- Fully implemented exiting audio object parameters modification.
- Commented out "Unknown item group declaration" warning because it always triggers for item ID 939, but it's not clear what exactly triggers it.
- Made RME use only "data" directory and moved all fof files there. Got rid of versioned directories.
- Implemented audio deletion using popup menu.
- Implemented map export as whole PNG image.
