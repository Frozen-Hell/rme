- Implemented "Audio" palette in RME which is form containing controls for audio configuration.
- Long time spent figuring out how brushes and their rendering work in RME. 
- Implemented "point" and "area" audio types brushes rendering.
- Implemented "point" and "area" audio types rendering when they're already drawn by corresponding brush on the map, i.e. when they're associated with particular tile.
	Point audio source also has red circle drawn, indicating its radius.
