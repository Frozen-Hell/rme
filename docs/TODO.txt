- Fix sprites drawn on spawn and waypoint (probably replace them with appropriate sprites from fof.dat).
- Need to be able to modify parameters of existing audio points and areas.
- Try to get rid off "Unknown item group declaration message".
- Probably get rid of versioned directories in RME and leave only plain "data" directory with files from "960" version.
- Export map as whole PNG image.
