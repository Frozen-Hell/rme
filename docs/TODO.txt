- Fix sprites drawn on spawn and waypoint (probably replace them with appropriate sprites from fof.dat).
- Implement audio saving into XML. Make additional field in map properties to set audio XML file.
- Implement "View" menu options to show audio areas and audio point sources (separate items).
- Try to get rid off "Unknown item group declaration message".
